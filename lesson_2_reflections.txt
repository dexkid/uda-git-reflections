Q - What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Ans - During initialization of repository, git software is let known that a new repository is about to be created. So please keep sufficient resources in place. It also allows the repository to under the tree structure about to be committed in.

Q - How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Ans - The staging area is a temporary place holder where files are placed before checking them into the repository. It allows one final change locally before comitting in the files in the repository.

Q - How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Ans - A logical change can be a simple one liner or few lines across multiple files. The logical change can be added to the staging area using the git add command. Now one can go about working on other changes. But when it is the time to commit, the files in the staging representing one logical change will be comitted first. By making use of 'git diff --staged' command, one can be sure of the changes being committed to the repository.
